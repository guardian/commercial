# @guardian/commercial-core

This directory contains the modules that are published as the `@guardian/commercial-core` npm package.

## Installation

To install the npm package, install with your favourite package manager:

```bash
pnpm i @guardian/commercial-core
yarn add @guardian/commercial-core
npm i @guardian/commercial-core
```

## Development

build the package with:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will build the package into the `dist` directory, which is what is published to npm.

#### Beta Releases
You can add the [beta] @guardian/commercial-core label to your pull request, this will release a beta version of the bundle to NPM, the exact version will be commented on your PR.

In order to do this, run `pnpm changeset`. This will create a new changeset file in the .changeset directory. Commit this file with your PR.

Note: Once the beta version is released, the label will be removed from the PR, so you will need to add it again if you want to release subsequent new versions.

## Releasing to NPM
This repository uses changesets for version management.

To release a new version with your changes, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset add
```

and follow the prompts. This will create a new changeset file in the `.changeset` directory. Commit this file with your PR.

When your PR is merged, changeset will analyse the changes and create a PR to release the new version.

if you are part of the `commercial` team, you can merge the changeset PR to release the new version. If you are not part of the `commercial` team, you will need to ask someone who is to merge the PR for you.
