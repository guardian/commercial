# E2E testing

- Test for specific features.

- Fine to repeat yourself in tests (don't extract out constants, functions, etc).

- As much as possible we want to test from a user's visual point of view, rather than trying to assert on some internal functionality. There will be some exceptions to this (e.g. Prebid).

- The high priority features we'd like to have some confidence about:
    - For some of the fixed ad slots (top-above-nav, mostpop, comments, right, etc...):
        - Ad slot div is present on the page
        - An iframe is placed inside the div that comes from GAM. Can we visually compare the contents of the iframe against a fixed snapshot?
        - Test presence / size of slots at different breakpoints
    - CI:
        - Can we run the test automatically when pushing commits / raising PRs?
    - Spacefinder
        - Use an ad test with a fixed size creative so that all ads placed in inline slots on a test page are the same.
        - Assert that Spacefinder inserts the same number of ads on a given page for a given run.
        - Assert that each ad is in the expected position. We could do this by checking the paragraphs after which ads are inserted.
    - Prebid
        - Check that Prebid is sending bids.
        - How we can check that the response from Prebid is correct?
    - Ad targeting
        - Mock out the state required to build ad targeting e.g. cookies, local storage, consent state, page level targeting (e.g. is sensitive).
        - Check that the targeting sent to GAM on each request has the expected targeting. Check slot-level targeting and so on.
        - Prebid ad targeting: Assert that key-values are properly added by Prebid e.g. `hb_pb`, `hb_bidder`, etc.
    - Consent
        - TCF: If the user doesn't consent we shouldn't show ads.
        - TCF: Ads don't render until the user gives consent.
        - AUS: Check if a user selects "non personalized advertising" that the targeting is different.
        - USNAT: Check if a user selects "do not sell my information" that the targeting is different.

- Lower priorities features:
    - Commercial metrics
    - Messenger: cross iframe communication
    - Passback (Teads and Connatix)
    - Amazon A9
    - Permutive
    - Ads refresh after 30seconds
    - Non refreshable line items
    - Outstreams don't refresh
    - Pageskins
    - Collapsing ads (1x1 and 2x2)
    - Delete ad slots (e.g. when you switch to mobile breakpoint we remove top-above-nav)
    - Ads get inserted into liveblogs when new blocks are added
    - Comment ad slot refreshing when paginating discussion (check this!)
    - Is there anything we'd like to test with Creative Templates?
