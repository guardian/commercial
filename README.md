# @guardian/commercial

This package contains the code for the commercial bundle that is loaded on all pages on theguardian.com.

There are 2 main parts to this repo:
- The commercial bundle itself, which is a set of javascript files that is loaded on all pages on theguardian.com.
- Some modules that are used by other parts of the Guardian codebase, such as DCR. This is published as a package to npm, `@guardian/commercial`.

The exported modules are in `src/core`, everything else is part of the commercial bundle.

## Installation

To install the npm package, run `pnpm i @guardian/commercial`.

## Development

### Requirements

-   Node
    -   see [.nvmrc](../.nvmrc) for the current version
    -   the version manager [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) is recommended with additional configuration to automatically switch on [changing directory](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#shell-setup)
-   pnpm

### Setup

To install dependencies, run `pnpm`.

To develop locally on the bundle, run `pnpm serve` to start a local server. This will watch for changes and rebuild the bundle. Serving it at `http://localhost:3031`.

### Releasing to NPM

This repository uses [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management

To release a new version with your changes, run `pnpm changeset add` and follow the prompts. This will create a new changeset file in the `.changeset` directory. Commit this file with your PR.

When your PR is merged, changeset will analyse the changes and create a PR to release the new version.

### Pull requests

Try to write PR titles in the conventional commit format, and squash and merge when merging. That way your PR will trigger a release when you merge it (if necessary).

### Working locally with DCR

1.  To point DCR to the local commercial bundle, in the `dotcom-rendering/dotcom-rendering` directory run:

    `COMMERCIAL_BUNDLE_URL=http://localhost:3031/graun.standalone.commercial.js PORT=3030 make dev`

    This will override `commercialBundleUrl` passed via the page config from PROD/CODE.

1. In another terminal start the commercial dev server to serve the local bundle:

    `pnpm serve`

### Testing locally with DCR

To run the unit tests:

`pnpm test`

To run the Playwright e2e tests:

Follow the steps above to run DCR against the local bundle.

`pnpm playwright:run` will run the tests on the command line

`pnpm playwright:open` will open the Playwright UI so you can inspect the tests as they run

### Working locally with Frontend

To use the bundle locally with Frontend, you can override your default Frontend configuration ([see the Frontend docs for more detail on this](https://github.com/guardian/frontend/blob/038406bb5f876afd139b4747711c76551e8a7add/docs/03-dev-howtos/14-override-default-configuration.md)) to point to a local commercial dev server. For example, save the following in `~/.gu/frontend.conf`:

```
devOverrides {
    commercial.overrideCommercialBundleUrl="http://localhost:3031/graun.standalone.commercial.js"
}
```

Frontend will then use the local bundle instead of the one from PROD/CODE. Frontend will pass the local bundle URL along to DCR, so you don't have to override there if you've done it in Frontend.

### Linking

To use the production bundle locally with Frontend, run `pnpm link` in the bundle directory. Then run `yarn link @guardian/commercial` in the frontend directory. Finally, start the frontend server as usual.

Frontend will then use the local bundle instead of the one from PROD/CODE.

### Testing on CODE

To test the bundle on CODE, create a PR, wait for github actions to run and a riff-raff comment should appear. Click the link in the comment to confirm the CODE deployment.

Although you can deploy CODE changes without deploying Frontend or DCR, it's a good idea to flag any CODE deployments on the dotcom semaphore chat in case it has an effect on anything anyone else is testing.

#### Testing changes to the `@guardian/commercial` npm package
You can add the [beta] @guardian/commercial label to your pull request, this will release a beta version of the bundle to NPM, the exact version will be commented on your PR.

In order to do this, run `pnpm changeset`. This will create a new changeset file in the .changeset directory. Commit this file with your PR.

Note: Once the beta version is released, the label will be removed from the PR, so you will need to add it again if you want to release subsequent new versions.

### Deploying to PROD

When you merge to main the commercial bundle will be deployed automatically and should be live within a few minutes.
