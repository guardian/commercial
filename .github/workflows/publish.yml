name: Publish NPM Package

# This workflow is triggered by either:
# - A "beta release" label being added to a PR which publishes a beta version of the bundle to npm
# - The success of the CI workflow on the main branch, which runs the changeset command to recognise new version candidates and releases to NPM
# In both cases, a changeset needs to be present for this to have any effect. Use `pnpm changeset` to add a new changeset

on:
  # Trigger on a label being added to a PR, and publish a canary versions of all packages with waiting changesets to npm.
  # This action will release the changeset as a pre-release, and add a comment to the PR with the version number
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]

  # Trigger for standard (changesets) release after CI on main
  # If a changeset PR is merged to main, this will publish a new version of the package to npm
