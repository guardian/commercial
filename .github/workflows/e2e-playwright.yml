      # We always run our commercial code against the latest main of DCR
      # This does make our tests sensitive to changes in DCR
      # (e.g. imagine someone removes the top-above-nav slot from DCR)
      # This is something we accept in order to easily test our own code
      #
      # Note we use the containerised version of DCR, published from:
      # https://github.com/guardian/dotcom-rendering/blob/6a6df272/.github/workflows/container.yml
      #
      # The argument `--network host` is crucial here, as it means the container shares the networking stack of the host
      # This makes the commercial dev server available from inside the container
      # Note that GHA provides a service container feature, but it does not support this argument
